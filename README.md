# Ferris Sweep Keymap

This repo contains my [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) keymap file for the [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) keyboard.

This keymap was heavily inspired by [Ben Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wZ8FRwOzhU) and [Sethu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VShLPvF693k)'s videos.
